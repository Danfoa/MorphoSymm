# E3: Euclidean Group symmetries____________________________________
# Dihedral and Cyclic groups are 2D rotations/reflections, this axis determines in which plane in 3D are these
# isometries acting on. That is this is the plane normal to the 2D space in which the isometries act.
# QJ: Joint Space symmetries____________________________________
#   3Dof per finger in the order : [Shoulder abduction, shoulder flexion, elbow] * 3
