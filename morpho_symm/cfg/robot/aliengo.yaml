# QJ: Joint Space symmetries____________________________________
#  Each leg is parameterized by a:
#    Hip joint (1,): 1DoF revolute joint with position constraints
#    Thigh joint (2,): 1DoF revolute joint with NO position constraints, thus modeled as a point in the unit circle
#    Calf joint (1,): 1DoF revolute joint with position constraints
# The action of the reflection is defined by the permutation of the configurations of the legs, such that:
#    FL <---g---> FR and  HL <---g---> HR.
#        ____FL_______|_____FR______|_________HL______|____HR____________|
